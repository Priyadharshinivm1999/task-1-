**task-2: Write a blog on difference between document and window objects **

** DEFINITIONS of Document Object : **
1.The document object represents your web page.
2.If you want to access any element in an HTML page, you always start with accessing the document object.
3.It is a programming interface that allows us to create, change, or remove elements from the document.
4.We can also add events to these elements to make our page more dynamic. 

** DEFINITIONS of Window Object : **
1.The window object is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy. 
2.It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage. 
3.Whenever a window appears on the screen to display the contents of the document,
the window object is created. 



**Differences between Document and Window Objects :**


*DOCUMENT-->It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser.

WINDOW OBJECT-->It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.  



*DOCUMENT-->It is loaded inside the window.

WINDOW OBJECT-->It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser.



*DOCUMENT-->It is the object of window property.

WINDOW OBJECT-->It is the object of the browser.



*DOCUMENT-->All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document.

WINDOW OBJECT-->Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.



*DOCUMENT-->We can access the document from a window using the window. document

WINDOW OBJECT-->We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window



*DOCUMENT-->The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model)

WINDOW OBJECT-->The window is part of BOM, not DOM.



*DOCUMENT-->Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies,
            etc can also be accessed by a window like this window. document.title

WINDOW OBJECT-->Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.



*DOCUMENT-->syntax:

      document.propertyname;

WINDOW OBJECT-->syntax:

        window.propertyname;



*DOCUMENT-->example:

     document.title :  will return the title of the document

WINDOW OBJECT-->example:

    window.innerHeight : will return the height of the content area of the browser
